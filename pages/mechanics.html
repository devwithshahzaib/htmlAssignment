      <h1 class="heading">Introduction:</h1>
      <p>
        Mechanics is the branch of physics that studies the motion and behavior
        of objects under the influence of forces. This webpage provides an
        exploration of the fundamental concepts and principles of mechanics,
        ranging from kinematics to dynamics. Discover the laws of motion, the
        principles of energy and momentum, and the applications of mechanics in
        various fields, including engineering, physics, and everyday life.
