      <h1 class="heading">Introduction:</h1>
      <p>
        Optics is the branch of physics that deals with the study of light and
        its behavior. This webpage provides an exploration of the fundamental
        concepts and principles of optics, ranging from the nature of light to
        the properties of lenses and mirrors. Discover the phenomena of
        reflection, refraction, diffraction, and interference, and understand
        how optics plays a crucial role in various fields, including physics,
        engineering, and imaging technologies.
      </p>
